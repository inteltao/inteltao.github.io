My name is Zui Tao and you can also call me Steven. I am currently a graduate student at Information Networking Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in cloud PaaS and other networking backend service. I want to build things that people really care. You may check out my CV online [here](https://inteltao.github.io/online-cv/)
