outline: Let's play Dark Souls III in an easier way.
---
I am kind of free recently so I play [Dark Souls III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_III) again on my PS4. When played this game for the first time, just like many people suggested, I choose Knight class. Knight it very easy to control if you are a beginner, but if you just use weapons to deal massive physical damage, you would lose a lot fun as a mage in Dark Souls. So this time let's try a different way, how about pyromancer?

## Pros and Cons of playing first as a pyromancer
---
### Pros

* Literally EXPLOSIVE Damage: In `Dark Souls III`, many, many foes are weak on fire, and that's what pyromancer best at.
* Make it much simpler for dealing with many bosses: This is a advantage of the ranged socerires, many bosses are harmless when you are far from it but you can cause damage to them.
* Invisible is COOOOOOL, masking the noise is COOOOLER. Yes, you can play this game as Assassin's Creed.  

### Cons
* You will be extremely likely to die at the first part of the game because you have little HP and little guard.
* The difficulties to control the character is much higher simply because you have to not only take care of your HP, stamina, but also your FP.
